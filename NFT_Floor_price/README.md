<h2> NFT Floor Price Web Scraping</h2>
<h3>using Python (Selenium, Beautiful Soup)</h3>

<p>With powerful Python libraires of Selenium and Beautiful Soup, any website can be scrapped. If one need to regularly check a particular website and collect useful information from there, that process can be easily automated. </p>
<p>I have scraped the NFT Floor Price website, that contained latest information of 488 NFT items (as of 11 Nov 2022), in 10 pages. The challenge with that particular website was, that such info gets loaded partially, and once user move the vertical scroll bar the new NFT data get loaded on screen. So, through the automation, I had to consider moving the scroll bar to load and collect all the available items.</p>
