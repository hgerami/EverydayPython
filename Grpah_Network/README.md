<h2>Collect data from TMDb and visualize co-actor network</h2>
<p> I collected data using an API for The Movie Database (TMDb) and constructed a
graph representation of this data that shows which actors have acted together in various movies, and useArgo Lite to visualize this graph. 
The following steps has been undertaken into the Python code: </p>
<ol>
<li>	Implementation of the Graph class  </li>
<li>	Implementation of the TMDbAPIUtils class </li>
<li>  Producing nodes.csv and edges.csv. Those two files need then to be uploaded  
to Argo-Lite website.</li>
<li> Visualizing a graph of co-actors using Argo-Lite </li>
</ol>
